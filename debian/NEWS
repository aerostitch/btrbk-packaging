btrbk (0.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    As the retention policy semantics changed with btrbk-0.23.0, the
    configuration files created for earlier versions are not
    compatible, and will force btrbk into "failsafe mode". Please read
    "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md"
    <http://digint.ch/btrbk/doc/archive/btrbk-0.23.0/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.html>
    before upgrading to btrbk-0.23.0.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.
